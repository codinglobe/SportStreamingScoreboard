# SportStreamingScoreboard

Welcome to the Sports Streaming Scoreboard project! This project is designed to provide a customizable and dynamic scoreboard for sports streaming, allowing you to enhance the viewer experience during live events. The project is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

Prerequisites:

    Ensure you have a local server set up (e.g., XAMPP) to run the PHP scripts and display the scoreboard correctly.

Getting Started:

    Clone the Repository:

    bash

    git clone [repository_url]

    Set Up Local Server:
        Install and configure XAMPP or any other local server of your choice.
        Place the project files in the server's root directory.

    Start the Local Server:
        Start your XAMPP server or the chosen local server.

    Access the Scoreboard:
        Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost/[path_to_project].

Project Structure:

    update.php: PHP script responsible for creating and updating the JSON file with scoreboard information.
